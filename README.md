# compute.es

This package provides a comprehensive set of tools/functions to easily derive and/or convert statistics generated from one's study (or from those reported in a published study) to all of the common effect size estimates, along with their variances, confidence intervals, and p-values. Several additional statistics are generated, including NNT (number needed to treat), U3 (Cohen's U3 distribution overlap statistic), CLES (Common Language Effect Size) and Cliff's Delta (success rate difference). The compute.es package's functions will convert a variety of statistics, such as means and standard deviations, t-test or p-value and sample size, to estimates of:

 (1) Cohen's d (mean difference)  
 
 (2) Hedges' g (unbiased estimate of d)
 
 (3) r (correlation coefficient)
 
 (4) z' (Fisher's z) 
 
 (5) log odds ratio 
 
 (6) the variances, confidence intervals and p-values of the above estimates
 
 (7) Other statistics: NNT, U3, CLES, Cliff's Delta 
 

The functions in this package can compute the effect sizes from a single study or from multiple studies simultaneously.  The compute.es package uses recommended conversion formulas as described in The Handbook of Research Synthesis and Meta-Analysis (Cooper, Hedges, & Valentine, 2009).
